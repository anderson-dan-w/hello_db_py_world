# Hello db py world!

This is a command line program that inserts data to the database.

Scenario:

You are the data troll who allows what data can be pushed up.
All data requests are in your hands. But first you gotta become
the official data troll by getting your info in the data troll table (you need to be legit in the database or else it didn't happen ;P)

Goal:

This is a super simple example of how python can be friends with database (in this case postgres). The goal is to
show how simple it is to use python to interact with postgres while having oodles of fun! hisssss!

There will be one table that we will be pushing data to: user_scratch.data_trolls

Fields you will be updating:
name (text)
favorite_color (text)
employee_start_at (date)
title (text)
enjoyed_lunch_n_learn (boolean)
